# xc

XC is a parallel executer written in Go. It offers you a nice CLI with a number of handy commands to run tasks on servers in parallel, autocompletion, a simple DSL to express host lists in a laconic way and things like that.

Try running xc and entering the `help` command. The most useful commands are `exec`, `runscript`, `hostlist` and `distribute`. Feel free to use `help <command or topic>` to get more info on those.

## Building

Xc project is structured using go modules so the building process is as easy as typing `go build -o xc cmd/xc/main.go`

## DSL

In XC hosts are combined into groups and may belong to a datacenter, groups may be combined into other groups, and any group may belong to a workgroup (you may think of workgroups as of projects), which reflects _inventoree_ storage structure.

A reference note: _Inventoree_, previously known as _conductor_ was originally developed as a http backend for one of early versions of Xc (called _executer_ those days).

Every host list may be written as a expression of comma-separated tokens, where every token represents a host, a group of hosts, or a whole workgroup of groups of hosts.

`host1.example.com` is a single host.

`%group1` represents a group.

`*workgroup` represents a workgroup.

`@some_dc` may be postfixed to a token to filter the resulting hostlist by a datacenter

`#tag1` may be postfixed to a token to filter the result by a given tag

Any token may be excluded if it starts with `-` symbol.

Here is a piece of internal documentation on xc expressions:

```
    Some self-explanatory examples:
        host1,host2                         - simple host list containing 2 hosts
        %group1                             - a group of hosts taken from inventoree
        %group1,host1                       - all hosts from group1, plus host1
        %group1,-host2                      - all hosts from group1, excluding(!) host2
        %group2@dc1                         - all hosts from group2, located in datacenter dc1
        *myworkgroup@dc2,-%group3,host5     - all hosts from wg "myworkgroup" excluding hosts from group3, plus host5
        %group5#tag1                        - all hosts from group5 tagged with tag1
```

## Backends

At the moment xc supports 3 backends to load hosts/groups data from

### Ini file

The most easy to start with is "ini" backend. Configuration is as simple as these three lines:

```
[backend]
type = ini
filename = ~/xcdata.ini
```

The format of the ini-file itself is simple but flexible as you can see in the following self-explanatory example

```
[datacenters]
dc1
dc2

[workgroups]
workgroup1

[groups]
group1 wg=workgroup1 tags=tag1,tag2
group1.1 wg=workgroup1 parent=group1 tags=tag3,tag4

[hosts]
host1.example.com group=group1 dc=dc1
host2.example.com group=group1.1 dc=dc2
```

All the fields given in equation format, i.e., groups/dcs/tags for hosts or workgroups/tags for groups are optional.

### Conductor (Legacy Inventoree)

**Conductor** backend uses legacy v1 API of Conductor/Inventoree 5.x-6.x. This API doesn't require authentication
and provides the whole data xc may use via single handler `/api/v1/open/executer_data`. It's easy to configure as follows:

```
[backend]
type = conductor
# url is the base url of the conductor/inventoree instance
url = http://c.inventoree.ru
# you can optionally restrict the data to specified workgroups
work_groups = workgroup1,workgroup2
```

### Inventoree

**Inventoree** backend utilizes the modern inventoree API v2 which is supported since inventoree 7.0. There's no specific handler for xc though so the data loading is performed in several steps. It's still faster than conductor backend as it doesn't rely on internal inventoree recursive data fetching. The configuration is similar to **conductor** however it's mandatory to configure `auth_token` option, as in inventoree all API handlers require authentication.

```
[backend]
type = inventoree
url = http://v7.inventoree.ru
work_groups = ...
auth_token = ...
```

## Password manager

In some cases, it's handy to keep su/sudo passwords for hosts somewhere and use them instead of typing in proper password within xc itself any time you need it. There is a possibility to write a password manager for xc in form of a Go plugin:

```go
package main

var (
	log func(string, ...interface{})
)

// Init initializes the plugin
func Init(options map[string]string, debugf func(string, ...interface{})) error {
	log = debugf
	return nil
}

// GetPass returns password for a given hostname
func GetPass(hostname string) string {
	return "MySup3rP@ssw0rd"
}

func PrintDebug() {}

func main() {}
```

To build such a plugin use `go build -buildmode=plugin passmgr.go` command. This will provide a .so file, i.e. dynamic library. To configure xc to use it as a password manager, add the following section to the xc configuration file:

```
[passmgr]
path = /path/to/your/passmgr.so
option1 = value1
option2 = value2
```

The only mandatory option is `path` which is used to load your library by xc itself. Any option besides that will be passed in as the first argument to your `Init()` function. The second argument is a reference to xc's logger debugf which you can use to write to xc's log file. Returning anything except `nil` from the Init function will cause xc to consider the initialization failed and not use the password manager. 

Any time xc needs a password for a host, the `GetPass(hostname string)string` function is called. This behaviour may be temporarily turned off by typing `use_password_manager off`.

There may be an optional `PrintDebug()` function in your plugin which is accessible by typing `_passmgr_debug`. This is useful to debug your code.
