List of hosts is represented by <host_expression> in its own syntax which can be learned 
by using "help expressions" command.

exec can proceed in 3 different modes: serial, parallel and collapse.

In ` + term.Colored("serial", term.CWhite, true) + ` mode the command will be called server by server sequentally. Between servers in list 
xc will hold for a delay which can be set with command "delay".

In ` + term.Colored("parallel", term.CWhite, true) + ` mode the command will be executed simultaneously. All output will be prefixed by 
host name which the output line belongs to. Output is (almost) non buffered so one can use
parallel mode to run "infinite" commands like "tail -f" which is handy for watching logs from 
the whole cluster in real-time.

The ` + term.Colored("collapse", term.CWhite, true) + ` mode is a lot like the parallel mode however the whole output is hidden until
the execution is over. In this mode xc prints the result grouped by the output so the differences
between hosts become more obvious. Try running "exec %group cat /etc/redhat-release" on a big
group of hosts in collapse mode to see if they have the same version of OS for example.

While the execution mode can be switched by "mode" command, there's a couple of shortcuts: 
    c_exec 
    p_exec
    s_exec 
which are capable to run exec in collapse, parallel or serial mode correspondingly without switching
the execution mode`,

To learn mode about <host_expression> type "help expressions".

runscript simply copies the script to every server in the list and then
run it according to current execution mode (Type "help exec" to learn more 
on execution modes), i.e. it can run in parallel or sequentally like exec does.

There are also shortcut aliases c_runscript, s_runscript and p_runscript for calling runscript
in a particular execution mode without permanent switching to it.`,

Example: 
    alias ls local ls               - this will create a local alias "ls" which actually runs "local ls"
    alias uptime p_exec #1 uptime   - this creates a local alias "uptime" which runs "p_exec <ARG> uptime"
                                      <ARG> will be taken from the alias command and put into p_exec command,

Configuration is split to 3 sections: main, executer and inventoree.

main.user is the user which will be set on xc startup. If empty, the current system user is used.

main.mode is the execution mode which will be set on xc startup. See "help mode" for more info on execution modes.

main.history_file sets the history file

main.cache_dir sets the cache dir for data derived from inventoree

main.rc_file is the rcfile which will be executed on xc startup. See "help rcfiles" for more info.

main.raise is the raise mode which will be set on xc startup

main.exit_confirm is boolean setting for disable or enable confirmation on exit

main.backend_type is type of backend, conductor or localjson or localini now

main.local_file is path to json or ini local file, used when backend_type is localjson or localini

executer.ssh_threads limits the number of simultaneously running ssh commands.

executer.ssh_connect_timeout sets the default ssh connect timeout. You can change it at any moment using connect_timeout command.

executer.ping_count is not implemented yet and does nothing

executer.progress_bar sets progressbar on or off on xc startup

executer.remote_tmpdir is a temporary directory used on remote servers for various xc needs

executer.delay sets a delay in seconds between hosts when executing in serial mode. See "help delay" for more info

inventoree.url sets the url of the inventoree service

inventoree.work_groups is a comma-separated list of work_groups which will be downloaded from inventoree.

Some self-explanatory examples:

    %group1                             - a group of hosts taken from inventoree

    %group1,-host2                      - all hosts from group1, excluding(!) host2
    %group2@dc1                         - all hosts from group2, located in datacenter dc1
    *myworkgroup@dc2,-%group3,host5     - all hosts from wg "myworkgroup" excluding hosts from group3, plus host5
    %group5#tag1                        - all hosts from group5 tagged with tag1
